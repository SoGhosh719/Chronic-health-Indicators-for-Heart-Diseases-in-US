Introduction

Our research project explores how healthcare customers are categorized according to chronic illnesses to transform patient care approaches. Through the integration of machine learning classifiers, descriptive analysis, and linear regression modeling, our all-encompassing methodology provides a multimodal comprehension of the course of the disease, the effectiveness of treatment, and the consequences for patients.
Heart disease has been the leading cause of mortality in the United States for the past 100 years, according to the 2024 heart disease and Stroke Statistics: A Report on U.S. and Global Data from the American Heart Association. In a Harris Poll from 2023, which was done on behalf of the American Heart Association, more than half (51%) of participants said that heart disease was not the country's top cause of death.
Segmentation, encompassing diseases like Asthma, Cancer, Cardiovascular disorders, and diabetes, relies on data from a diverse and reputable source named Kaggle. Through meticulous analysis of this data, we aim to categorize patients according to their specific disease type, treatment requirements, and geographical location.
Our goal is to equip medical professionals with the knowledge and resources to diagnose and treat patients promptly, anticipate probable illnesses and their symptoms, and choose the best course of action. Through an analysis of past patient causes and symptoms, we want to improve disease prognosis, offer less painful treatment alternatives, and guarantee full recovery.
In conclusion, our research aims to reshape the delivery of healthcare by using cutting-edge analytical methods to divide patients into groups according to the presence of chronic illnesses. By using this cutting-edge method, we hope to open the door for tailored and optimal care plans that improve patient outcomes and well-being.
